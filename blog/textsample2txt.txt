The World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and is the official world championship of the game of snooker.[1] The sport of snooker was founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India.[2] Originally, the sport was played in the United Kingdom,[3] however in modern times, the sport has been played worldwide, especially in East and Southeast Asian nations, such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand.[4]

The world championship sees 32 professional and qualified amateur players compete in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several frames. The 32 players for the event are selected through a mix of the world snooker rankings, and a pre-tournament qualification round.[5][6] The first world championship in 1927 was won by Joe Davis, the final being held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England.[7][8] Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.[9]

Stephen Hendry is the most successful player in the modern era, having won the championship 7 times.[10] The previous year's championship was won by Wales' Mark Williams, who won the event defeating Scotland's John Higgins in the final 18–16.[11][12] This was Williams' third championship, having won in 2000 and 2003 previously. The winner of the 2019 event earned prize money of £500,000, from a total pool of £2,231,000.[13]

The 2019 World Snooker Championship was held between 20 April and 6 May 2019 in Sheffield, England. The tournament was the last of twenty rankings events in the 2018/2019 season on the World Snooker Tour. It featured a 32-player main draw to be played at the Crucible Theatre, as well as a 128-player qualifying draw which took place at the English Institute of Sport from 10 to 17 April 2019, finishing three days prior to the start of the main draw. This was the 43rd consecutive year that the tournament was held at the Crucible, and the 51st consecutive year the championship was contested through the modern knockout format.[5][6]

The top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players.[a] Defending champion Mark Williams was automatically seeded 1st overall. The remaining fifteen seeds were allocated based on the latest world rankings (revision 10), which were released following the China Open, the penultimate event of the season. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as best of 19 frames. The number of frames needed to win a match increased with each successive round, leading up to the final match which was played as best of 35 frames.[5][6]

All 16 non-seeded spots in the main draw were filled with players from the qualifying rounds. The qualifying draw consisted of 128 players, including 106 of the remaining 112 players on the World Snooker Tour, as well as twenty-two wildcard places allotted to non-tour players. These invited players included the women's world champion, the European junior champion, and all four semi-finalists at the amateur championship. As with the main draw, half of the participants in the qualifying draw were seeded players. Players ranked from 17th to 80th were allocated one of 64 seeds in order of their ranking, while all of the other participants were placed randomly into the draw. To reach the main draw at the Crucible, players needed to win three best of 19 frame matches.[14][5]

They were Ronnie O'Sullivan (five titles: 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2013), John Higgins (four titles: 1998, 2007, 2009, 2011), Mark Selby (three titles: 2014, 2016, 2017), Mark Williams (three titles, and defending champion: 2000, 2003, 2018), Shaun Murphy (one title: 2005), Graeme Dott (one title: 2006), Neil Robertson (one title: 2010), and Stuart Bingham (one title: 2015).[5] This was O'Sullivan's 27th consecutive appearance in the final stages of the World Championship since his debut in 1993, equalling Stephen Hendry's 27 consecutive appearances, and three short of Steve Davis's record of 30 total appearances. Four other former world championship finalists also competed: Ali Carter (twice: 2008 and 2012), Judd Trump (once: 2011), Barry Hawkins (once: 2013), and Ding Junhui (once: 2016).[14][5] The youngest player to participate in the main stage of the tournament was Luo Honghao at 19 years of age,[15] while 46-year-old Mark Davis was the oldest; both players entered the main draw through qualifying.[16]

Tournament summary
Qualifying rounds

James Cahill became the first-ever amateur to qualify for the World Championship main stage at the Crucible.
The top sixteen seeds automatically qualified for the main competition.[5] The defending champion Mark Williams is seeded first, whilst other seeds are allocated based on the world rankings following the 2019 China Open.[5] All the other players competed in the preliminary qualifying rounds, and were required to win three best-of-19 matches to reach the finals.[5]

The qualifying rounds took place at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield from 10 to 17 April 2019, with 16 players progressing to the finals. 128 players competed in the qualifying stage, including those tour players not automatically qualified for the main competition and invited amateurs.[17]

James Cahill became the first amateur player ever to qualify for the Crucible main stage of the World Championship, defeating fellow amateur Michael Judge 10–6 in the third qualifying round.[18] Seven players – the highest number since 1999 – made it through the qualifying rounds to make their debuts at the main stage of the tournament. Besides Cahill, they were Scott Donaldson, Michael Georgiou, Li Hang, Luo Honghao, Tian Pengfei and Zhao Xintong.[19] 2006 World Champion Graeme Dott and two-time finalist Ali Carter also qualified for the main stage.[19]

First round
The draw for the first round of the championship was made on 18 April 2019, the day after the conclusion of the qualifying rounds and two days before the start of the main event. The matches were drawn by World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn, and 1991 World Champion John Parrott.[20] The first round of the championship took place between 20 and 25 April 2019. Each first round match was played over two sessions as best of 19 frames.[21]

Top half
The tournament began with defending champion Mark Williams (seeded 1) drawing Martin Gould.[22][23] Gould took the first frame of the match, with a break of 64, before Williams won the next five with breaks of 55, 54 and 129 to lead 5–1.[24] Gould won frames seven and eight, before Williams took the final frame of the session with a break of 97 to lead 6–3.[24][25] The second session was also played on the opening day of the event. In frame ten, Williams opened up a lead, before Gould made a clearance to force a respotted black, but it was Williams who potted the black to lead 7–3.[26] Gould won frame 11, to trail 4–7, before Williams won the next two frames to go ahead 9–4.[25] Gould fought back with breaks of 70, 87 and 76, to trail 7–9, before Williams won the match 10–7, clinching a "nervy" 17th frame.[25] After his victory, Williams complained that World Snooker had not allowed his child backstage before the match, which the governing body denied.[27]


Shaun Murphy (seeded 13) completed the second ever whitewash at the World Championship main stage at the Crucible.
Shaun Murphy drew event debutant Luo Honghao. The match would be only the second whitewash ever at the Crucible, and the first since John Parrott defeated Eddie Charlton in 1992, finishing 10–0.[28] Luo accumulated the lowest number of points ever scored in a World Championship match, accruing just 89 points during the entire match, more than 100 fewer than the previous record low of 191 scored by Danny Fowler when he lost 1–10 to Stephen Hendry in 1993.[28] Neil Robertson met Michael Georgiou in the first round; Georgiou trailed 0–9 at the conclusion of the first session, having scored even fewer points than Luo in those frames. However, Georgiou won frame ten on resumption of play in the second session with a break of 90, to avoid both the whitewash and low points total. Robertson later won 10–1.[28]

Fifth ranked John Higgins played Mark Davis, with Davis having defeated Higgins in six of the pair's last seven encounters.[29][30] Higgins gained a 6–3 lead after his initial session, before spending the night in Royal Hallamshire Hospital because his brother Jason had fractured his kneecap by falling down the stairs at the venue. Higgins then won the match the following day 10–7.[31]

Two former winners of the event, Graeme Dott (2006 winner) and Stuart Bingham (2015 winner), met in the first round of the competition. Bingham led 8–1 after the first session, and later 9–4, before Dott won five frames to level the match at 9–9. Bingham won the deciding frame after Dott missed a simple black ball shot.[32] Following the match, Dott stated that "serious sleeping problems" had caused him issues playing.[33]

Bottom half

Qualifier Gary Wilson won the longest ever World Championship frame at the Crucible in the first round decider against Luca Brecel.
The match between Gary Wilson and Luca Brecel, which featured a large amount of tactical play, had to be suspended when the afternoon session overran with Wilson leading 9–8.[34] When the match resumed in the evening, Brecel won frame 18 to send the match to a deciding frame. This frame first required a re-rack, then set the record for the longest frame ever played at the Crucible, at 79 minutes and 31 seconds.[b][34] After leading 6–3 overnight, Ding Junhui defeated Anthony McGill 10–7.[35]

Having lost in the first round eight times in his previous 15 appearances at the Crucible, Stephen Maguire played debutant Tian Pengfei. In frame 17, Maguire was 7–9 down and needed a snooker on the colours to stay in the match. He won a snooker on the blue, then missed a risky pot to a baulk corner, which he missed, but the blue hit the cue ball again and went into another baulk pocket, a shot later called "an outrageous fluke" by Maguire.[36] He added pink and black to steal the frame, and then took the next two frames to win 10–9.[37] Former three-time winner and world number 2 Mark Selby played debutant Zhao Xintong. Despite having been behind 1–5 after the first six frames, Selby won nine of the next eleven frames with two breaks of 131 to win 10–7.[16]

Amateur player James Cahill drew the world number one Ronnie O'Sullivan, who had been in the final of both Triple Crown events earlier in the season. Cahill took the final frame of the first session to lead 5–4, and took an 8–5 lead in the second session, before O'Sullivan tied the match up at 8–8.[38] Cahill made an early break in frame 17, but fell apart on a simple red; O'Sullivan simply needed the final pink and black to win the frame, but missed the pink, allowing Cahill to take the frame. Cahill won the match 10–8 with a break of 56 in the final frame.[39] The win was Cahill's second win over the first ranked player in the season, having defeated Mark Selby in the first round of the 2018 UK Championship earlier in the season.[40] O'Sullivan commented after the match that he had been unwell during the match, however former champion Ken Doherty accused O'Sullivan of "playing too casually".[41]

Second round
The second round of the championships was played between 25 and 29 April, with matches being competed over three sessions as best of 25 frames. The initial session of the match between Shaun Murphy and Neil Robertson featured a maximum break attempt by Murphy.[42] With just the last two reds remaining, Murphy asked for the divider between the tables to be removed to allow all spectators to see the break attempt; however, Murphy would fail to finish the break.[43] Robertson won the initial three frames of the match, without Murphy attempting a pot, and led 5–3 after the first session, and 10–6 after the second.[44] Robertson later won the first three frames of the final session to win 13–6.[45] Post match, Murphy called Robertson "just too good" and "unplayable".[45]


16th seeded David Gilbert defeated the defending champion Mark Williams in the second round. He went on to reach the semi-finals.
Defending champion Mark Williams played David Gilbert. After the first session, with Gilbert leading 5–3,[46] Williams stated that he had suffered chest pains post session.[47] He was taken to Northern General Hospital overnight, but returned for the second session of the match, the following day.[47] Williams later tied the match at 7–7, but trailed 7–9 after the second session.[48] Gilbert then won the first four frames of the final session to win 13–9.[49][50]

Amateur player James Cahill drew fifteenth seed Stephen Maguire. Maguire led 5–3 and 9–7 after the first two sessions.[51] Cahill took three of the first four frames in the third session to draw level at 10–10. Cahill then won frame 21, to take the lead for the first time in the match, with Maguire drawing level in the following frame.[52] Frame 23 saw both players miss shots, with Cahill looking to win the frame before being penalised for a waistcoat foul, and later going in-off from a cannon, allowing Maguire to take the frame. Cahill won frame 24, after Maguire missed a green ball by a wide margin.[53] In the deciding frame, Maguire won the match 13–12.[52][54]

Three-time champion Mark Selby played qualifier Gary Wilson, but trailed 3–5 after the first session, before winning four out of the first five frames in the second session to lead 7–6. Wilson, however won the remaining three frames of the session to lead 9–7.[46] Selby later tied the match at 10–10, before Wilson won the next three frames to qualify for the quarter-finals.[49][55] 2013 runner-up Barry Hawkins won the first four frames of his match with Kyren Wilson,[22] with the first session finishing 6–2 to Hawkins. Hawkins made four century breaks of 105, 130, 111, and 137 including a maximum break attempt.[43][56] Wilson also made a century break in frame five, with four frames being won with a century in a row for the first time since Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry in 1999.[56] Wilson, however, won the second session of the match 5–3 to trail 7–9, before drawing level at 9–9 in the final session.[57] Despite Hawkins taking leads at 10–9 and 11–10, Wilson won the last three frames to progress, winning 13–11.[58] The match saw a record equalling 9 century break for a second round match at the world championships.[59]

Zhou Yuelong played Ali Carter in the only all-qualifier tie of the second round. Zhou took four of the first five frames to lead 4–1, then led after the first session 5–3, and held the lead at 9–7. On resuming the match in the final session, Carter won six straight frames to win 13–9.[58] Two former finalists, Judd Trump and Ding Junhui, met in the second round. Trump was ahead 5–1, before Ding took eight of the next ten frames to lead 9–7. Trump then won six frames in a row, including breaks of 93, 79, 54 and 103, to win the match 13–9.[60]

Quarter-finals
The quarter-finals were played on 30 April and 1 May, and similar to the previous round, matches were played as best of 25 frames across three sessions. In an all-qualifier match, Ali Carter played Gary Wilson. Despite playing in his first world championship quarter-final, and losing the first three frames of the match, Wilson won five straight frames to lead 5–3 after the first session.[61] The pair shared the next session, with both players winning four frames, with Wilson leading 9–7 into the final session.[62] Carter won two of the next three frames, including a break of 128 to trail 9–10, with Wilson winning the next three to progress 13–9.[63][64] Post-match, Carter said "You have to take your hat off to [Wilson]. I did not think he could play that good," commenting that despite his low ranking of 32, Wilson "has to be the favourite to win it now, the way he has been playing."[61]

2019 Masters winner Judd Trump played 15th seed Stephen Maguire. Trump had won six straight frames to win his second round match against Ding Junhui, and won the first six frames of this match scoring breaks of 131, 67, 106, 78 and 101, to lead 7–1 after the first session.[65] In the second session, Trump looked set to win the match without needing to play the final session, extending his lead to 9–1, however, Maguire won four of the remaining frames to trail 5–11 by the end of the session. Trump won the match after just three frames of the final session 13–6.[66][67] Maguire was fined for swearing in a post-match press conference, where he stated that his performance was "shit".[66][68][67]


4th seed Neil Robertson, lost in the quarter-finals to John Higgins.
David Gilbert played Kyren Wilson. The two had met in the 2019 German Masters final earlier in the season, with Wilson winning the tournament 9–7.[69] The two players shared the opening session 4–4, and Gilbert won six of the eight frames in the second session to lead 10–6 overnight.[66] Wilson won two of the first three frames of the final session to trail 8–11, but Gilbert took the final two frames to win the match 13–8.[66][70]

Four-time world champion John Higgins played Neil Robertson. Robertson took an early 3–1 lead, but Higgins tied the match at 4–4. Robertson pulled away to 7–4, with Higgins winning five frames in a row to take a 9–7 lead.[66] Higgins won the match 13–10, after sharing the final session, with a century break of 101 in the final frame to win.[71][72]

Semi-finals

John Higgins reached his third consecutive World Championship final, his career eighth.
The two semi-finals were played from 2 to 5 May, and were best-of-33-frame matches spread over four sessions. The first semi-final pitted four-time champion John Higgins against David Gilbert, who had never previously progressed past the second round.[73] Higgins took the first two frames, but Gilbert tied the match at 2–2 with a break of 94.[74] Higgins then went into a 3–2 lead, before Gilbert won the next three frames, including a maximum attempt, potting 15 red balls but failing a double on the black, to lead 5–3.[74]

The second session saw Gilbert increase his lead to 8–3, by winning three more frames including a 125 break.[75] He was also ahead 56–17 in frame 12 but missed a frame-ball pink into the middle pocket, before Higgins cleared the table to trail 4–8. Higgins also won the next two frames with breaks of 67, 52 and 58 to trail 6–8.[75] Gilbert, however, won the final two frames of the session to lead 10–6.[76] Pundit John Virgo said "[Higgins] is not with it", whilst six-time champion Steve Davis called Higgins' performance "ridiculous".[76]

On the return of the match for the third session, a member of the crowd was removed just after the break off shot in the initial frame, which was won by Gilbert to increase his lead to 11–6.[66] Higgins won two of the next three frames to stay four behind at 8–12.[77] Frame 21 saw Higgins make a 143 break, the highest of the tournament, and also the 86th century break of the tournament, tying the record for century breaks in one world championship, which was first set in 2015.[77] Gilbert won the next frame, falling short of a century, with a break of 91.[77] Despite this, Higgins won the final two frames of the session to trail 11–13.[78]

In the fourth and final session, Gilbert took frame 25, but Higgins won the next four frames to go ahead for the first time since leading 3–2 in the first session of the match.[79] Gilbert won the next two frames, to lead 16–15, before Higgins scored a 139 break to level the match at 16–16. The deciding frame was won by Higgins, after Gilbert missed the black ball from the spot.[79] Post-match, both players gave emotional press conferences, with Gilbert commenting "I have never won anything, I have come close but this is the best couple of weeks I have had in my snooker career by a mile. It might be the closest I will come to winning the World Championship."[80] Higgins apologised for his poor play during the match, and for bringing Gilbert "down to [Higgins'] level in the first three sessions."[81]

The second semi-final was played between Judd Trump and qualifier Gary Wilson. They shared the opening session, 4–4, and Wilson later took the lead at 6–5, thanks to a break of 65. Trump won the next three frames with breaks of 73, 123 and 75 to lead 9–6 before Wilson compiled a 77 break, bringing the score to 9–7 after two sessions.[82] Both players were "nervy" during the third session.[83] Wilson won frame 17 with a break of 50;[84] however, Trump won the next three frames, including a break of 114, which was the 87th century of the championship (the all-time highest number of centuries compiled at any world championship).[85] Trump was 14–10 ahead going into the final session of the semi-final.[64]

Wilson took the first frame in the final session, but Trump won the next three frames to win the match 17–11.[86] After the match, Trump suggested that despite them reaching the final, neither he nor Higgins had played particularly well in their respective semi-final matches.[87] Wilson, ranked 30 in the world, said that "Judd deserved to win", but commented on the playing conditions being poor, saying: "I wasn't good enough yesterday, but I've got to say that table is disgusting. It's running off all over the place, you're getting square bounces, kicks every other shot".[88][89]
